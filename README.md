## How to Run?
### Front-End:
- For the front-end download node.js from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install it. When the installation is complete, cd to the frontend directory and type to the terminal `npm install`. This will install all required frameworks.  After that check back-end installation.


### Back-End:
- For the back-end you will need `brew`. Install brew from https://brew.sh/index_tr here then:
- `brew tap mongodb/brew`
- `brew install mongodb-community`
- `brew services start mongodb-community` 
- Then cd to the backend and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to start:
- `cd frontend`
- `npm start`
- In the other terminal `cd backend`
- `python app.py`

Note: If the installation setup does not work please mail to tunalim@mef.edu.
